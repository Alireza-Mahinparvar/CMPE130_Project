CMPE 130 Project Report

Participants: Alireza Mahin parvar , Saber Bakar , Vinayan Kathiresan

Problem: 
Due do the situation we have right now with covid-19 we wanted to know how can we get list of countries based on their cases or how can we sort them alphabetically or how can we find number of cases based on the name of country


Soloution Description:
For our project we decided to implement a chaining hash table, min-heap, max heap and BST based on nodes that contain the name of the country and the number of cases it has. We are going to use the hash table to be able to find the number of cases when the name of a country is input, the min-heap to print the list of countries cases Alphabetically, max heap to print the list of countries based on the number of cases and the binary search tree to find the country by the number of cases.
Complexity Analysis:
 
 

Tools used for Programming:
Each of us had different kind of IDE to work for this Project like Visual Studio, Netbeans and Alireza Used github to copy all the codes into the repository

Contributions:
Alireza Worked on implementing Max heap and Binary search Tree
Saber Bakar worked on Implementing Min heap
Vinay worked on Implementing Hash table and test Cases for whole program

Conclusion:
For this project based on the situation we have right now we tried to come up with problem and apply our problem solving skills to solve it. We used different kind of algorithms we learned in this semester and we analyzed them to see how efficient they are. Max-heap, Min-heap, BST and Hash Table
